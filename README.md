# Email Spam Filtering

### Description
Develop a machine learning model using email data to automatically detect spam emails. The project involves:
- Cleaning and preprocessing the email text for analysis (including tokenization and feature extraction).
- Training classification models like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Neural Networks to distinguish between spam and non-spam emails.
- Evaluating the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliable spam detection.

This model aims to enhance email security by filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains labeled email data for spam and non-spam classification. You can download the dataset from Kaggle:  
[Email Spam Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prishasawhney/email-classification-ham-spam)

After downloading, place the file `emails.csv` (or equivalent) in the project directory.

## Steps in the Project
1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Clean email text (e.g., remove HTML tags, punctuation, and stopwords).
   - Tokenize and extract features using techniques like Bag of Words (BoW) or TF-IDF.

2. **Model Training**
   - Algorithms used: Naive Bayes, SVM, Neural Networks.
   - Train models on labeled data to learn patterns distinguishing spam from ham (non-spam).

3. **Evaluation Metrics**
   - Accuracy
   - Precision
   - Recall
   - F1-score

## Libraries Used
- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy (Data handling and processing)
- Scikit-learn (Modeling and Evaluation)
- NLTK or SpaCy (Text preprocessing and tokenization)

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository and navigate to the project folder.
2. Download the dataset from Kaggle (link above) and place the file in the project directory.
3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
